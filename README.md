**Fighting Irish Freestyle Lyrics - Drake
**
[Intro]

I love you more

Conductor

Yeah

[Verse 1]

The summer is over, I missed it, barrel was smoking, I kissed it

Ferris showed us the renders for Texas, it's unrealistic

Cut 'em the check 'cause I hate reviewin' the budgets and limits

Just pay the man

The world fell in love with the gimmicks, even my brothers got tickets

Seemed like they loved every minute

Just know this shit is personal to us, and it wasn't just business

Analyzin' behavioral patterns, it's somewhat suspicious

Niggas was never happy for me when I'd run up the digits

Or when I'm breakin' world records still, as I guzzle a Guinness

Or when I get my fifth Maybach 'cause the color is different

'Member we traded watches? I gave you that Arabic dial, you gave me a numbered edition

You would even check up on my son like a pediatrician

Sure convinced the gang this shit was rooted in love when it isn't

Show me how different we are, there's blessings in juxtaposition

I guess now you boys gotta abandon your summer tradition

Cold shoulders I gave in the Hamptons, it come with the distance

Figured we was always gon' be close, like ovens and kitchens

I was sadly mistaken, the loyalty wasn't a given

See Drake Live

Get tickets as low as $115

[Break]

It's all good

Conductor

[Verse 2]

And niggas cried the blues for you, sayin' it wasn't malicious

Talkin' 'bout we family, well, I'm not the cousin to visit

God forbid we ever got to tarnish your public image

All that brother talk as if I really discovered a sibling

Six degrees, my memory's retrivin' our humble beginnings

Niggas wanted trouble, grabbed the shovel and dug up some ditches

Cover my body in dirt but that wasn't me

That wasn't me

That was a body double and we've done dozens of switches

Niggas tried to light the front gate up, it wasn't for Christmas

I said a prayer that morning for Sean, and it wasn't religious

It came from a place of desperation and utter submission

Rappin' was over for now, it came like a sudden decision

I don't give a fuck about you snakes or these other musicians

Niggas started fuckin' with my family, I'm goin' to prison

And we all crashin' out together, my brothers complicit

Who put a pipe bomb in your trunk? It wasn't Xzibit

I'm tryna blow the doors off that bitch when you touch the ignition

But then I gotta remember who made this shit come to fruition

[Break]

Conductor

It's me

[Verse 3]

Who's got the most to lose, and who's in that other position?

Signal conversations, well, I hope they got double encryption

I'd hate to see the empire crumble on judge's convictions

This nigga pulled a rabbit out the hat, and y'all love a magician

It's funny to see you all rejoicin' and huggin' and kissin'

What are we celebratin'? I'll rent out the club at Edition

Nothing was the same with all you bitches and nothing's forgiven

But next time, bury me in gold, my blood is Egyptian

The Dennis genes come out when the vodka is floodin' my system

I don't have a drinkin' problem, I got a subtle addiction

I got my father's habits and I got my mother's permission

My dad has another child, I told him that wasn't my sister

Grew up with dozens of Jews, churches with dozens of Christians

Also, developed a deep respect for the Muslim religion

I'm starin' at my daddy while y'all tell me I wasn't that nigga

[Outro]

That's fuckin' crazy

That's-
